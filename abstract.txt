ABSTRACT

Smart Digital Locker System

Project Introduction and Motivation

The Smart Digital Locker System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to facilitate secure, contactless item exchange through smart physical lockers. In an increasingly digital world where convenience and safety are paramount, this system addresses the growing need for secure item transfer without requiring physical meetings between parties. The project leverages modern web technologies and secure authentication mechanisms to create a user-friendly platform that bridges the gap between digital convenience and physical storage solutions. The motivation behind this system stems from the challenges faced in traditional item exchange methods, including scheduling conflicts, security concerns, and the need for flexible access to stored items.

Problem Statement

Traditional item exchange methods often require both sender and receiver to be present at the same time and location, creating logistical challenges and potential security risks. Existing solutions lack comprehensive automation, real-time tracking, and secure verification mechanisms. There is a significant need for a system that allows users to deposit items in secure lockers at their convenience and enable receivers to collect them using secure credentials without direct person-to-person interaction. The system must handle multiple users, manage locker availability across different locations, process transactions securely, and provide real-time notifications to all parties involved in the exchange process.

System Overview

The Smart Digital Locker System is a full-stack web application that implements a secure item exchange platform with role-based access control. The system consists of two main user interfaces: a user dashboard for regular users and an admin dashboard for system management. Users can register for an account, search for available lockers by location, deposit items with detailed information, and share secure one-time passwords (OTPs) with receivers. The system manages a hierarchical structure of locations organized by states, cities, and locker points, making it scalable for geographic expansion.

The workflow begins with users selecting an available locker and providing item details along with receiver information. The system generates a unique OTP that is sent to the receiver via SMS and email. Receivers can then collect items by entering the correct OTP at the locker location. The system tracks all transactions, calculates billing based on storage duration, and maintains comprehensive audit logs. Administrators have access to system management tools including locker configuration, user management, and system monitoring capabilities.

Technologies Used

The frontend is built using React 18 with TypeScript, providing type safety and enhanced developer experience. The user interface is styled with Tailwind CSS for responsive design and consistent visual appearance. State management is handled by TanStack Query for efficient data fetching and caching. The backend utilizes FastAPI, a modern Python web framework known for its high performance and automatic API documentation generation. Data persistence is managed through PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM for efficient database operations. Authentication is implemented using JWT tokens with Argon2 password hashing for enhanced security. The system incorporates Redis for caching and rate limiting, while Twilio integration enables SMS notifications for OTP delivery.

Implementation Approach

The system follows a microservices-inspired architecture with clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend components. The backend implements RESTful APIs following OpenAPI standards, with comprehensive input validation and error handling. Database models are designed using SQLAlchemy with async support for optimal performance. The frontend employs a component-based architecture with reusable UI components and custom hooks for state management. Security is implemented at multiple layers including input validation, SQL injection prevention, and secure authentication flows.

The booking system implements real-time availability checking to prevent double bookings. OTP generation uses cryptographically secure random generation with expiration timers to ensure security. The billing system calculates charges based on hourly rates with automatic transaction completion when items are collected. Notification services handle both email and SMS communications with template-based messaging for consistency.

Expected Results or Benefits

The Smart Digital Locker System provides numerous benefits including enhanced security through encrypted OTP verification, convenience through 24/7 access to lockers, and reduced coordination overhead between senders and receivers. Users benefit from real-time locker availability information, detailed transaction history, and automated notifications. The system's hierarchical location management enables scalability across multiple geographic regions. Administrative tools ensure efficient system management and monitoring.

The automated billing system eliminates manual payment processing while providing transparent pricing based on actual usage. The contactless nature of the system addresses health and safety concerns while maintaining high security standards. The comprehensive audit trail and transaction logging provide accountability and dispute resolution capabilities.

Conclusion Statement

The Smart Digital Locker System successfully addresses the challenges of traditional item exchange methods by providing a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform for contactless item transfer. The implementation demonstrates modern web development practices with robust security measures and efficient data management. The system's architecture allows for future enhancements including mobile applications, additional payment methods, and integration with existing logistics platforms. This project serves as a practical solution for secure item exchange while showcasing the effective application of modern web technologies to real-world problems.
