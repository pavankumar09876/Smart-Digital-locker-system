Prompt for Frontend Development:

Develop a modern React.js frontend application with TypeScript that integrates seamlessly with the provided FastAPI backend for a Smart Digital Locker System. The frontend must exactly match all backend API endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication flows, and business logic. Use the following specifications:

Technology Stack:
React.js with TypeScript
Axios for API calls
React Router for navigation
Context API or Redux for state management
JWT token handling for authentication
Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS or Material-UI
Form validation with React Hook Form
Core Requirements:
1. Authentication System (Exact Match to /Auth routes):
Signup Page: Form with fields matching createuser schema:

name (string, min 3, max 50 chars)
email (EmailStr)
password (string, min 6 chars)
POST to /Auth/signup → Handle success/error responses
Login Page: Form with fields matching LoginRequest schema:

email (EmailStr)
password (string)
POST to /Auth/login → Store access_token and refresh_token in localStorage
Response matches TokenResponse schema
Token Management:

Automatically include Authorization: Bearer <access_token> in all authenticated requests
Implement automatic token refresh using /Auth/refresh endpoint
Handle token expiration gracefully
User Profile: GET /Auth/me → Display user info matching userResponse schema (name, email)

Admin Routes Protection: Only show admin features if user role is 'admin'

2. Location Management (States & Cities):
States:

GET /states/ with query param state → Display state info with cities
GET /states/all → List all states with nested cities and locker points
Admin: POST /states/ (name), PUT /states/{state_id}, DELETE /states/{state_id}
Cities:

GET /cities/ → List all cities with locker points
GET /cities/{city_id} → City details with locker points
GET /cities/by-state/{state_name}/{city_name} → City by state/city names
Admin: POST /cities/ (name, state_id), PUT /cities/{city_id}, DELETE /cities/{city_id}
3. Locker Points Management:
GET /locker-points/ with optional city_id filter → List locker points with nested lockers
GET /locker-points/{locker_point_id} → Locker point details with lockers
Admin: POST /locker-points/ (name, address, city_id), PUT /locker-points/{locker_point_id}, DELETE /locker-points/{locker_point_id}
4. Lockers Management:
GET /lockers/ with optional locker_point_name filter → List lockers (users see only AVAILABLE, admins see all)
GET /lockers/{locker_id} → Locker details
Admin: POST /Admin/ (locker_point UUID), PUT /Admin/{locker_id}/status (status: AVAILABLE/OCCUPIED/MAINTENANCE), DELETE /Admin/{locker_id}, DELETE /Admin/{locker_id}/force-clear
5. Items Management (Core Business Logic):
Add Item: POST /Items/ with fields matching ItemCreate schema:

name, locker_id (UUID), your_email, receiver_phone_number, receiver_emailid, description (optional)
Response matches ItemResponse schema
Handle locker availability validation
Request OTP: POST /Items/lockers/{locker_id}/request-otp with contact (phone/email) matching ItemOTPRequest schema

Rate limited (3 requests per 5 min for request, 5 attempts per 5 min for collect)
Collect Item: POST /Items/lockers/{locker_id}/collect with otp matching ItemCollect schema

Response includes billing calculation (₹50/hour)
Handle OTP expiration (5 min), invalid OTP, billing display
6. UI/UX Requirements:
Dashboard: Show available lockers, recent items, user profile
Locker Search: Filter by locker point name, show status (AVAILABLE/OCCUPIED)
Item Flow: Step-by-step wizard for adding item → receiver collection
Admin Panel: CRUD operations for lockers, locker points, states, cities
Notifications: Display success/error messages for all API responses
Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach for locker access on phones
7. Error Handling & Validation:
Match all backend error responses (400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 429)
Form validation matching Pydantic schemas (email format, min/max lengths)
Handle rate limiting (429 errors) with user-friendly messages
Network error handling with retry mechanisms
8. Business Logic Implementation:
Billing: Display calculated bill on item collection (hours * ₹50)
Status Management: Real-time locker status updates
OTP Flow: Secure OTP input with expiration countdown
Role-based UI: Hide/show features based on user role
9. API Integration Details:
Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000 (match backend CORS settings)
All requests must handle async nature of backend
Implement loading states for all API calls
Cache frequently accessed data (states, cities, locker points)
10. Testing Requirements:
Unit tests for API service functions
Integration tests for complete user flows (add item → collect)
E2E tests for critical paths
Mock API responses for development
Ensure the frontend is production-ready with proper error boundaries, loading states, and accessibility features. The application should provide a seamless experience for both regular users and admins, exactly mirroring the backend's capabilities and constraints.
